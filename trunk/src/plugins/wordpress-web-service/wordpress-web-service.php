/**
 * Catches index.php/wpws requests, stops further execution by WordPress
 * and handles the request depending on the request type.
 *
 * The are 3 types of treatment:
 * 1) User hasn't requested a WSDL file nor a SOAP operation => HTML output of general information
 * 2) User has requested requested WSDL file => deliveration by SoapServer instance
 * 3) User has submited a SOAP operation request => treatment by SoapServer instance
 *
 * Because the caller needs to know where he can access the service
 * the correct blog address needs to be specified in the service port of the WSDL.
 * For that reason only a template WSDL file exists. Should the script detect that
 * a customized WSDL with the correct address doesn't exist it creates it
 * by making a copy of the template WSDL and by replacing the address placeholder.
 * Should you ever need to reallocate the Blog simply delete the wpws.wsdl but provoke it's recreation.
